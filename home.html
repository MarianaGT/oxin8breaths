          This tour 'Oxford in eight breaths' is a departure from traditional walking tours of the city but mostly relies upon the use of creative strategies to explore our current 'Airscape' to connect the walkers with the world around them. The tour culminates in an interactive discussion and focuses on personal action and empowerment.</p>
