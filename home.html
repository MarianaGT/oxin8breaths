        <p> The Air is not just an empty space. Over the summer and early autumn we ran a total of 10 tours and angaged over 100 people in the project in the centre and west Oxford.
          With attendees from the Oxford City Council, the Oxfordshire County Council, Friends of the Earth and
        the Oxford Pedestrians Association. Asked to create a special tour for Low Carbon West Oxford for their 10 year anniversary celebrations.</p>
        <p>Join us and explore the city of Oxford and its history as we take you on a journey from past, present, and future to debate one of the most critical challenges of our time.
        This tour 'Oxford in eight breaths' is a departure from traditional walking tours of the city but mostly relies upon the use of creative strategies to explore our current 'Airscape' to connect the walkers with the world around them. The tour culminates in an interactive discussion and focuses on personal action and empowerment.</p>
        <p>In the Social Sculpture field, we work through connective practices to build an active and response-able citizenship. The space offered in this project will enhance the confidence in your own discoveries and findings to develop attentive and responsive criteria</p>
        <p>We collected many postcards from Oxford residents voincing their support for more to be done to tackle air pollution in the city and nationwide.</p>
