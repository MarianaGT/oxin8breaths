    <p> The Air is not just an empty space
      With attendees from the Oxford City Council, the Oxfordshire County Council and
    the Oxford Pedestrians Association</p>
    <p>Join us and explore the city of Oxford and its history as we take you on a journey from past, present, and future to debate one of the most critical challenges of our time.

This tour 'Oxford in eight breaths' is a departure from traditional walking tours of the city but mostly relies upon the use of creative strategies to explore our current 'Airscape' to connect the walkers with the world around them. The tour culminates in an interactive discussion and focuses on personal action and empowerment.</p>
  <p>In the Social Sculpture field, we work through connective practices to build an active and response-able citizenship. The space offered in this project will enhance the confidence in your own discoveries and findings to develop attentive and responsive criteria</p>
